# chatbot-ubc
My attempt to create a platform which let strangers (students, staffs, etc) around UBCO chat and make more friends.

### Idea:
Shout out to [dnhuan](https://github.com/dnhuan/TDNchat) and [hieplpvip](https://github.com/ptnkchat/ptnkchat).

### Language:
Typescript but I have to change the extension from .ts to .mjs in order to process.

### Deloyment:
Computer -> Heroku -> Computer -> Github.

### Version:
**v1.0:**   Users have to type the commands, no intructions, no pretty UI.</br>

**v2.0:**
* Users can use buttons in the menu.
* Speed up the procedures by open and close database only once.
* No more losing data due to dyno sleeping (heroku).
* Infinite wait time.
